Our CE programme is designed to produce graduates who have a range of knowledge, understanding and skills in the hardware and the software technologies of computer systems. This is made possible by the unique combination of subjects from computer science and electronic engineering disciplines within the Computer Engineering course.Computer Science is concerned with the efficient application of computing technology, especially through the design of efficient algorithms and data structures, design methodologies and language paradigms. There is also an emphasis on the practical design of efficient and reliable software to meet given specifications.There are overlapping topics in Computer Science and Computer Engineering, including computer architecture, networks, and information storage and management. The fundamental principles used by both disciplines are similar, as both recognize the constraints imposed by existing technology and applications. The differences, however, are in the emphasis placed at the algorithmic and conceptual levels. Hence, the Computer Science course will focus more on software design and construction compared to the Computer Engineering course. The Computer Science course will not have subjects on circuits and basic electronics, digital communications, etc., but will include strengths that are well-known in all the NTU engineering courses: industrial attachments, group projects, practice-oriented approach, etc.Graduates of the B.Eng. (Comp. Eng.) course bring with them expertise in a range of topics including electronic and microprocessor systems design, digital signal processing, control systems and computer architecture.

Logon to your Windows domain (staff/student) with your&nbsp;Network username and password. There are two main methods of getting to your personal web folder. [Note that the old method of connection via drive H is no longer in use.] Method 1: Via command line shortcut on the Run dialog boxYou will need to know your directory name. This method is very good for those using a later version of Windows like Win 2000. The reason is because the operating system keeps a very large record of past command line typed and has a smarter identification for folder names -- it automatically lists available folder names on the remote file source that best match what you have currently keyed in. E.g. if your home directory name is homeX and your username is testing, then type this at the Run... dialog box in the Windows Start button menu area.<a href=\"file://web/homeX/testing\">file://web/homeX/testing</a>&nbsp; Method 2 : Via shortcut on desktop If you like to drag and drop files to folders on your desktop, this method is most suitable. This is especially so when the PC is for your personal use. Create a shortcut to the personal web folder. You only have to do this ONCE. Right click on any empty area on the desktop. Select New -&gt; Shortcut Type in the path to your web folder. E.g. if your home directory name is homeX and your username is testing, then type \\\\web\\homeX\\testing at the command line (or location of file) dialog area. Then click Next. Give a name to the shortcut you have just created. You can name it anything you want. Click Finish. A new shortcut icon folder will be created on your desktop. Subsequently to edit files on the web folder, you simply double click on it to open your personal web folder on the Web server. You can edit the files there as per normal. You can also drag and drop files to this folder just as you would for any other folder that resides on your own PC.

Each year, only well-motivated students with good academic grades are admitted to the Stream. The number is kept intentionally small to maximise student-staff interaction. Upon graduation, the student is awarded the degree of Bachelor of Engineering (Mechanical) with an additional certificate attesting to his/her specialisation in design.The design stream curriculum is heavily biased towards both theoretical and practical design. Subjects such as Engineering Innovation and Design (the former IHPT), Industrial Attachments (IA) and Final Year Projects (FYP) have a strong design bias. To expose the student to real world design, design professionals from industry are often invited as assessors of student projects and to update staff and students on new developments in design.

And they do not have to type in the filename of the first page. E.g. http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits displays the CITS website. With a default home page, there is no need to type in a file name like http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits/index.htm The browser will automatically display the full path when the first URL is typed, if the directory has a default home page file. The advantages are that the URL is shorter, and not everyone remembers the filename. E.g. calling your first page as homepage.html is not a good idea as people may not know if it is homepage.htm or homepage.html or even homepage.asp The shorter the URL, the better. To have a default start page, the file has to be named specially. The allowed names are default.asp (for an ASP page) default.htm, index.html or index.htm. In other words, the content of this file will be displayed when net-surfers point their browser at your URL. E.g. There is no need to state the file name if you name your first file to be displayed as index.htm. [Note that no scripting, including ASP scripting, is generally allowed.] There can only be one file called index.htm in each directory. If you have multiple directories, you may like to call each of the first files as index.htm Try not to have more than one default file in a single directory. Because any one of them may be displayed as the default page depending on how the web server is configured.

In our syntax, this may cause an account to be lockout under the following 3 situations:1. Your Windows PC is not configured to logon to the staff/student domain and you type a user name and any password when you boot up. 2. Your NT workstation/server is configured as stand-alone. 3. You logon to another domain other than staff/student, eg your lab domain, using Windows workstation/server. AND If you do the following :-&nbsp;Read your NTU email using Inbox or Outlook.&nbsp;- Connect to a file resource located on the staff/student domain by either mapping a drive, using the UNC convention, type net use in a MSDOS prompt, browsing to that resource using network neighbourhood, etc.&nbsp;- &nbsp;Check the print queue or print to a printer located in the staff/student domain. What actually happens is that the operating system will try to use the user name and password that you have type in when you logon to try to authenticate to the resource located in the staff/student domain. Eg. User test logons to lab1 domain using password \"hello\". He tries to print to a printer in the staff domain.The operating system will pass the user name \"test\" to the staff domain controller and see if there is also another user call \"test\" in the staff domain. If it finds one, it will use the password \"hello\" to try to logon to the user \"test\" in the staff domain. Everything works fine if both passwords are the same. The problem arises if both passwords are different. This will cause invalid logon attempts to the user \"test\" in the staff domain.In some cases, the operating system does a retry several times before giving up. This increases the invalid/bad logon attempts several times. You will notice this when you are sometimes prompted for a user name and password when you try to print or read your NTU email.Important : If your user name is the same on both domains and the passwords are different, you may end up locking yourself up. If they are different, you might be unknowingly locking out another user on the staff/student name who has the same user name as your local domain! In that case, please contact your local network administrator and change your user name on your domain to be the same as your staff/student domain.Recommendations : There may be some other applications which periodically tries to connect to the staff/student domain using your local domain user name and password. Thus it is best to make sure that the user names on both domains are the same and make both passwords the same.&nbsp;For those who are interested in more details, check out the following knowledge base articles by Microsoft.

The field of study, you're your content knowledge, whether it be physical and mathematical sciences or engineering seems to matter less in many careers in today's rapidly moving economy. And new careers are being defined all the time.There will also be a percentage of science undergraduates who will aspire to be like Yang Chen Ning, James Watson, or Andrew Wiles, and they will want to proceed further to undertake research leading to a PhD degree, either locally or overseas.

Our CE programme is designed to produce graduates who have a range of knowledge, understanding and skills in the hardware and the software technologies of computer systems. This is made possible by the unique combination of subjects from computer science and electronic engineering disciplines within the Computer Engineering course.Computer Science is concerned with the efficient application of computing technology, especially through the design of efficient algorithms and data structures, design methodologies and language paradigms. There is also an emphasis on the practical design of efficient and reliable software to meet given specifications.There are overlapping topics in Computer Science and Computer Engineering, including computer architecture, networks, and information storage and management. The fundamental principles used by both disciplines are similar, as both recognize the constraints imposed by existing technology and applications. The differences, however, are in the emphasis placed at the algorithmic and conceptual levels. Hence, the Computer Science course will focus more on software design and construction compared to the Computer Engineering course. The Computer Science course will not have subjects on circuits and basic electronics, digital communications, etc., but will include strengths that are well-known in all the NTU engineering courses: industrial attachments, group projects, practice-oriented approach, etc.Graduates of the B.Eng.

Role-based Email Accounts In conjuction with the free webspace, student clubs may also apply (via StudentLink) for role-based email accounts for their clubs. Role-based email accounts are available in blocks of 20 accounts at $13.90/block/year. Role-based eamil account is required for posting student club's events in NTU event calendar and Campus Buzz. &nbsp; Ad-hoc role-based accounts for short projects are included in this 20-accounts block allotment.

Courses are allocated randomly, except for the first allocation (the first allocation will be after the system closes at 10 p.m. on the first day of Add/Drop) whereby higher study year students are generally given priority. This is in line with the previous practice in which students were scheduled by seniority (i.e. higher study year students were scheduled earlier) to access STARS on the first day of the Add/Drop period. Senior students have a shorter time remaining before the end of their candidature to clear their courses. Students can be allocated as many courses as there are on their waiting list up to their maximum semester load (for those on Academic probation/Academic Warning, it will be up to normal load). For exchange/non-graduating students, the maximum load will be 6 courses or 20 AU. If the index number that a student has chosen is not available, the system may allocate him to other index numbers of the same course with available places. Please note that the daily allocation during Add/Drop period is not dependent on the time of the day students place their courses on waiting list, i.e. students do not get a higher chance of allocation by putting their courses on waiting list early; hence there is no need to rush.

It is an extension of Formmail.pl, a general purpose submission form. (Refer to <a href=\"http://www.ntu.edu.sg/cits/gettinghelp/webpublishing/Pages/formmail_basic.aspx\">Using Submission Form in NTU</a> for details on Formmail.) SurveyMail is a Perl program that has been adapted from BFormMail.pl. The latter was written for Unix platform, but SurveyMail.pl was modified and enhanced for NTU's NT Web server. Like the normal Formmail.pl program, you will get an email detailing what the user has filled in, whenever a user fills in your survey form. But this time the responses will automatically be added into a text file in your personal Web account space, or anywhere in NTU's Web server where you have permission to write to. You can use the data in the text file in any software you like, e.g. Excel for tabulating and reporting purposes. (We do not teach you how to do it as it varies with the software you are using but usually the step involves importing a delimited text file.) Should you anticipate many responses, you have the option to turn off the emailing routine. (Otherwise your mailbox will be flooded with many entries.) Data will simply be appended into the text file as usual. If you suspect the program is not responding well at a later time, you can turn on the email feedback again. In the text file, fields are delimited with any character you like, and blank fields will be delimited by your self-specified delimiter in front and behind the empty field, leaving no space in between. A date and time stamp all automatically be placed as the first two fields in a record. If you have the email feedback turned on, you have the option to tabulate a subset of the input fields into the text file. That is, the email will show all the fields the user has keyed in, but the text-based data file will not keep track of all the fields. You have the option to tabulate only the fields you want. The text file is treated like a database. This file can be placed anywhere you want, even in a sub-directory in your personal Web account. With a one-time access to an NT machine, you can modify the Read/Write privileges of the file yourself, without help from Centre for IT Services. (Without modifying the file access privileges, the server-based SurveyMail program cannot write to your database file.) The advantage of being able to do it yourself is that you can give a meaningful name to your database, and you can place it in a location that is meaning to you. You can also have a few surveys going on at the same time since the each survey form can write to a different database file. But should you need help with the setting of file access privileges, we can help you with that as well.", "category": "Home > IT Services > Computer Software > Website Hosting & Publishing > Formmail and Surveymail programs > Using Surveymail in NTU", "question": "What is SurveyMail?"}, "qa2556": {"answer": "Answer: Yes, on a selective basis.", "category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > School of Biological Sciences > Double Degree in Biomedical Sciences and Chinese Medicine programme", "question": "Are interviews conducted as part of the admission process for the double degree in Biomedical Sciences and Chinese Medicine programme?"}, "qa2490": {"answer": "Answer: 400", "category": "Home > Undergraduate Admissions & Financial Assistance > Specific Programme Questions > Nanyang Business School > Bachelor of Business Programme", "question": "What is the number of Business students accepted per year ?"}, "qa657": {"answer": "Answer: The University may grant extension of candidature, on a case-by-case basis, to students whose candidature is expiring soon.
